How to generate and add dumpbin exports to the store:

* Find out what Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Windows is using. At a cmd.exe prompt run:

  >SET PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE

PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE will be either AMD64 or x86. The store uses x64 and x86 respectively.

* Find out the version of Windows you are running. At a cmd.exe prompt run:
  
  >VER
  
The version will be something like "Microsoft Windows [Version 6.0.6002]". The store uses only the version number.

* Generate the exports using dumpbin. The command needed depend on the Instruction Set Architecture:

If PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE is x86, at a cmd.exe prompt run:

  >DUMPBIN /exports %windir%\System32\[dll name].dll  > "dumpbin exports - [dll name] (Windows [version] [CPU] - System32).txt"

If PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE is x64, and you are using the the 64-bit version of DUMPBIN, at a cmd.exe prompt run:

  >DUMPBIN /exports %windir%\System32\[dll name].dll  > "dumpbin exports - [dll name] (Windows [version] [CPU] - System32).txt"
  >DUMPBIN /exports %windir%\SysWOW64\[dll name].dll  > "dumpbin exports - [dll name] (Windows [version] [CPU] - SysWOW64).txt"

If PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE is x64, and you are using the the 32-bit version of DUMPBIN, at a cmd.exe prompt run:

  >DUMPBIN /exports %windir%\System32\[dll name].dll  > "dumpbin exports - [dll name] (Windows [version] [CPU] - System32).txt"
  >DUMPBIN /exports %windir%\SysNative\[dll name].dll  > "dumpbin exports - [dll name] (Windows [version] [CPU] - SysWOW64).txt"
