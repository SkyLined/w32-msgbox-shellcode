How to generate and add dumpbin exports to the store:

1) Find out what type of CPU Windows is running on:
  C:\Users\SkyLined>set processor
  PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE=AMD64
  PROCESSOR_IDENTIFIER=Intel64 Family 6 Model 15 Stepping 11, GenuineIntel
  PROCESSOR_LEVEL=6
  PROCESSOR_REVISION=0f0b

PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE will be either AMD64 or x86. The store uses x64 and x86 respectively.

2) Find out the version of Windows you are running:
  C:\Users\SkyLined>ver
  
  Microsoft Windows [Version 6.0.6002]

The store uses only the version number.

3) Generate the exports using dumpbin:
  DUMPBIN /exports %windir%\System32\[dll name].dll  > "dumpbin exports - [dll name] (Windows [version] [CPU] - System32).txt"
  DUMPBIN /exports %windir%\SysWOW64\[dll name].dll  > "dumpbin exports - [dll name] (Windows [version] [CPU] - SysWOW64).txt"

On x86 systems, you only need to execute the first command.
